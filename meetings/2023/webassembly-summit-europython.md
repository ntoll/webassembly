# EuroPython 2023 Web Assembly Summit

Held in Prague. Event website here: https://ep2023.europython.eu/wasm

We had around 30 folks register, with the vast majority turning up, along with
"on the day" hangers on.

The day was organised as an un-conference by Nicholas and Roman and split in
two parts: ad hoc presentations in the morning, with discussions, hacking etc
in the afternoon.

## Presentations

The talks presented in the morning were:

* PyScript - a quick overview (Nicholas Tollervey - Anaconda)
* Load time and download size for Python in the browser (Roman Yurchak -
  Pyodide)
* Emscripten Forge (Thorsten Beier - Quantstack)
* The state of packaging in Pyodide (Hood Chatham - Anaconda / Pyodide)
* A history of Python in the Browser (Pascal Chambon)
* Python is the browser - Grail! (Russell Keith-Magee - Anaconda)
* Introducing SPy: Python-ish compiled directly to WASM (Antonio Cuni -
  Anaconda)

These were presented in a "seminar fashion" where people were encouraged to
respectfully interrupt, question, debate and otherwise constructively engage
during the presentation of the subject matter.

## Packaging debate

The main focus for discussion in the afternoon was packaging in the context of
web assembly. The TL;DR is something we've named the Lemburg Paradox (named
after Marc-Andre Lemburg who coined the concept):

> "The only conclusion we can reach when it comes to Python packaging, is that
> there is no conclusion."

These words of wisdom were uttered after an extensive, deep and broad debate 
containing many attendant experts in the field (Jannis Leidel [conda/PSF],
Thorsten Beier [EmscriptenForge], Hood/Roman [Pyodide], RKM [BeeWare] etc...).
It was suggested at the start of the conversation that we should aim to
conclude with a to-do list of next steps / collaborations / tasks we all agreed
ought to be done in the packaging space. In the end, so broad, diverse and
different are the various contexts in which people are working on packaging,
that the only rational conclusion is the Lemburg Paradox.

However, perhaps the most important side-effect of these presentations and
discussions was the friendliness of the debate and the resulting community
strengthening as all the different people working in this space were able to
meet, share ideas and learn something of the emergent geography of the
WASM/packaging community.

It was agreed we should do this again, and soon, in a similar format.
